            <p class="para1">With millions of students across 9 countries, we are India's largest Online Quiz Center in choosing the
                Stream for school children. We cater to the needs of
                school students of classes IX-X across leading educational boards. We realize that the choosing a stream
                of every student is unique based on her
                learning style, interests and her past academic history, and understanding this is the key to making
                every student successful.
